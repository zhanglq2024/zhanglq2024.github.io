## Get Started ‚Äì Deploy on GitHub Pages
### About Github Pages
> GitHub Pages is a free hosting service provided by GitHub, designed for creating and publishing websites directly from a GitHub repository. It allows developers, designers, and anyone with a GitHub account to host personal, project, or organizational websites without needing external hosting services. GitHub Pages works seamlessly with GitHub repositories, automatically generating a static website whenever new content is pushed.

#### Step 1. Click the ‚ÄúUse this template‚Äù button at the top-right corner of the [linkyee](https://github.com/ZhgChgLi/linkyee) Template Repo -> ‚ÄúCreate a new repository‚Äù:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b88da62-df4b-4f3b-a22c-e78b7527a92d)

#### Step 2. Check ‚ÄúInclude all branches,‚Äù enter your desired GitHub Pages repo name, and click ‚ÄúCreate repository‚Äù once finished:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3611204-7507-41a1-8221-707200a3e269)

> The GitHub Pages repo name will affect the access URL. If you enter `your-username.github.io` as the Repo Name, that will be the direct URL to your GitHub Pages site.
> If you already have a `your-username.github.io` repo, the GitHub Pages URL will be `your-username.github.io/Repo-Name`.

#### Wait for the fork to complete. You might encounter deployment errors during the initial setup due to forked repo permission issues. Let‚Äôs proceed with the steps to adjust this.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/038fac9e-83eb-4f2f-ba9a-88712b4af022)

#### Step 4. Go to Settings -> Actions -> General, ensure the following options are selected:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6851c4e6-9466-4800-862f-e9e5e5b65b11)

- Actions permissions: `Allow all actions and reusable workflows`
- Workflow permissions: `Read and write permissions`

After selecting, click the Save button to save your changes.

#### Step 5. Go to Settings -> Pages and ensure the selected branch for GitHub Pages is set to ‚Äúgh-pages‚Äù:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1802bc78-4615-4d29-b180-9c84f3fb8d6d)

> 	The message `Your site is live at: XXXX` above is your public GitHub Pages access URL.

#### Step 6. Go to Settings -> Actions and wait for the first deployment to complete:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e57336ef-2f35-4455-abc0-76dce07470ee)

#### Step 7. Access the GitHub Pages URL to ensure the fork was successful:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/023c39f7-9351-4175-8c9f-5eb42e2ecdb9)

> Congratulations! Deployment successful. You can now modify the configuration files with your own data. üéâüéâüéâ

#### Please note that after each files modification, you need to wait for GitHub Actions to complete the `Automatic build` and `pages build and deployment` tasks.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0ba637cc-3bb6-4458-a076-5f754c7429b3)

Refresh the page for the changes to take effect. üöÄ

### Customized
#### Modify Default Theme

- `./themes/default/index.html`
- `./themes/default/styles.css`
- `./themes/default/scripts.js`

#### Create a New Theme

1. `./themes/YOUR_THEME`
2. Update `theme:YOUR_THEME` in `config.yml` file

> Yes, you can use GenAI tools like ChatGPT to help you create your own custom link pages!

#### Automatic Redeployment

By default, the project redeploys automatically once a day to refresh the values of plugin's dynamic variables. You can adjust the [cron](https://crontab.guru/#0_0_*_*_*) settings in [build.yml](../../actions/workflows/build.yml):
```
schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'  # Runs daily at midnight (00:00 UTC)
```
If you don‚Äôt need scheduled redeployment, simply delete the schedule block.

## Custom Domain ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

You can set a custom GitHub Pages domain, such as my own: [https://link.zhgchg.li](https://link.zhgchg.li).
